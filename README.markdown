PHPUnit_Parallel
=============================

[PBWorks](http://pbworks.com/) parallelism for [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de), because it's been over four years since PHPUnit promised to support parallelism natively and I'm impatient

This is a history of my playing with PBWorks's OMGUnit (awesome name), to get a feel for how it works. It's only around now for historical purposes. I took what I learned here with me to PHPUnit itself. See that work in github.com/saucelabs/phpunit
