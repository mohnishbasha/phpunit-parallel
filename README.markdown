PHPUnit_Parallel
=============================

[PBWorks](http://pbworks.com/) and [SauceLabs](http://saucelabs.com) parallelism for [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de), because it's been over four years since PHPUnit promised to support parallelism natively

THIS IS NOT READY YET

You can install PHPUnit_Parallel via the [Sauce Labs PEAR channel](http://saucelabs.github.com/pear). Run this from your command line:

    pear channel-discover saucelabs.github.com/pear
    pear channel-update saucelabs.github.com/pear
    pear install saucelabs/PHPUnit_Parallel
